<p> Hello my name is Jacqueline but most people call me Jacki. I love animals even though most of my pets die :(
  I joined girls who code because I wanted to be more familiar with coding.</p>
<p> A fun Fact about me is I love amusement parks even though sometimes I get scared that I might fall off the rides.</p>
